# AttackGraph-2018

A Tool for Automated Generation and Analysis of Attack Graphs.

## Steps to Produce attack graph
* Model the network
* Produce an attack graph
* Analysis of attack graph

## Basic requirment's of attack graph 
* It should be **exhaustive**, it covers all possible attacks.
* It should be **succinct**, it contains only these state's of network, from which attacker can reach his goal.


## Progress
* Attack Graph for Static Topology
  1. Uclid for checking safety property of internal nodes.
  2. Python bfs, for checking safety property of internal nodes.
* Indroduction to Python Z3 API
  1. Bounded model checking to prove 2-safety property of fibonacci.
  2. Induction proof for 2-safety property of fibonacci.
